  <h4>Who are you?</h4>

<p> Nicholas Blue I'm a student currently at MSU studying Media and Information.  I'm interested in animation, video games, graphic and web design.</p>

<p> I work at Best Buy currently and I am helping my parents put me through college and hopefully have a career in animation.</p>

<p>I'm a big fan of video games, I love anything Nintendo and I'm big into cartoons.  Family Guy is one of my favorite shows of all time and it is my dream to animate my own show..</p>


<h4>What hardware do you use?</h4>

<p>I just use my MacBook Pro and have found that I have just about everything I need to do with it that I want.  My only critique on my MacBook is the fact that I can't play video games because I would like to learn to mod video games and add my own content.</p>


<p>The thing I need most importantly when I'm working on development is a quiet place a comfy chair and headphones.  Without music to drown out my other thoughts I would be completely lost.  Hip-hop, classic rock are all I need. </p>


<h4>Software</h4>



<p>I use Photoshop, Illustrator, Dreamweaver, Aptana, and Logic Pro as my primary software</p>

<p>I just started using GitHub and it is a different process I am used to adding content online.</p>

<p>Depending on what I'm doing I write code in Dreamweaver or Aptana.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I use Logic Pro X for music to create my own pieces and I like to use iTunes to store my music.</p>

<h4>Dream Setup</h4>

<p>My dream setup would be able to use only my phone to do everything I want.  I'm always on my phone reading whatever I can get my hands on.  If I could just have all my programs there and beam it to a monitor and have a keyboard that'd make life so much simpler to me</p>



<p>But my ideal setup would be a MacBook that I could build with my own components in order to maximize it's capabilities and allow me to play games.  </p>
